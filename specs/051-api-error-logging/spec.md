# Feature Specification: API Error Handling and Logging

**Feature Branch**: `051-api-error-logging`  
**Created**: 2026-01-09  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Implementation**: Existing code  
**Input**: User description: "API error handling and logging middleware"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Receive Consistent Error Responses (Priority: P1)

As an API client, I want errors returned in a consistent structure so I can handle failures predictably.

**Why this priority**: Inconsistent errors break client integrations and make troubleshooting harder.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering known errors and validating the response structure and status codes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a validation error, **When** I call an endpoint with invalid input, **Then** I receive a 400 response with problem-details fields.
2. **Given** an MT5 runtime error, **When** an endpoint fails, **Then** I receive a 503 response with a descriptive error.

### User Story 2 - Log Requests and Responses (Priority: P2)

As an operator, I want request and response logging with timing information so I can observe API behavior.

**Why this priority**: Logging is essential for diagnostics and performance monitoring.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by calling endpoints and verifying log output includes method, path, status, and duration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an API request, **When** it completes, **Then** a log entry records method, path, status, and processing time.
2. **Given** multiple requests, **When** they complete, **Then** the logs are consistent and include client information when available.

### User Story 3 - Add Process Timing Header (Priority: P3)

As an API client, I want a process timing header so I can measure server-side latency.

**Why this priority**: Timing information helps debug performance issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by calling an endpoint and verifying the presence of the timing header.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a successful request, **When** I inspect the response headers, **Then** I see a process-time header with a numeric value.
2. **Given** an error response, **When** I inspect the response headers, **Then** I still see the process-time header.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an unexpected exception occurs?
- How are validation errors reported for nested models?
- What happens when request client information is missing?
- How does logging behave under high load?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST convert exceptions into RFC 7807 problem-details responses.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST handle MT5 runtime errors with a 503 response.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST handle validation errors with a 400 response.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST handle unexpected errors with a 500 response.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST log requests and responses with timing information.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST include a processing-time response header for all responses.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **ErrorResponse**: Represents a standardized problem-details error payload.
- **RequestLogEntry**: Represents logged request metadata and timing.
- **ResponseLogEntry**: Represents logged response status and timing.

## Dependencies

- [specs/041-mt5-rest-api/spec.md](specs/041-mt5-rest-api/spec.md)
- [specs/046-mt5-api-service/spec.md](specs/046-mt5-api-service/spec.md)

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All errors are returned using a consistent problem-details schema.
- **SC-002**: Requests are logged with method, path, status, and duration.
- **SC-003**: Responses include a timing header for both success and error cases.
