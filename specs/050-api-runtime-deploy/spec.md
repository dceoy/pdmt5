# Feature Specification: API Runtime Configuration and Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `050-api-runtime-deploy`  
**Created**: 2026-01-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "API runtime configuration and deployment entrypoint"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Run the API from a CLI Entrypoint (Priority: P1)

As an operator, I want a CLI entrypoint to start the API so I can run the service without writing custom scripts.

**Why this priority**: A standard entrypoint simplifies deployment and operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the module entrypoint and verifying the server starts with expected host/port.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** environment defaults, **When** I run the module entrypoint, **Then** the API starts on the default host and port.
2. **Given** custom environment values, **When** I run the entrypoint, **Then** the API uses those values.

### User Story 2 - Configure Runtime via Environment (Priority: P2)

As an operator, I want to configure host, port, and log level via environment variables so I can adjust runtime behavior without code changes.

**Why this priority**: Environment-based configuration is a standard deployment practice.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting environment variables and verifying they take effect.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid environment values, **When** I start the API, **Then** the runtime uses those values.
2. **Given** invalid environment values, **When** I start the API, **Then** the runtime falls back to safe defaults.

### User Story 3 - Deploy as a Windows Service (Priority: P3)

As an operator, I want a documented path to deploy the API as a Windows service so it can run alongside MT5 on a dedicated host.

**Why this priority**: MT5 is Windows-only and requires a stable service deployment model.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying with a service manager and verifying the health endpoint.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Windows host with MT5 installed, **When** I configure the service, **Then** the API starts on boot.
2. **Given** the service is running, **When** I call the health endpoint, **Then** it reports status and version information.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the configured port is invalid?
- How does the service behave if the host is unreachable or not allowed?
- What happens when the API cannot bind due to permissions?
- How are log levels handled if an unknown value is provided?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a module entrypoint to launch the API server.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow host, port, and log level configuration via environment variables.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST fall back to safe defaults for invalid configuration values.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST log startup configuration for observability.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST document deployment steps for running as a Windows service.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **RuntimeConfig**: Represents resolved host, port, and log level values.
- **Entrypoint**: Represents the module entrypoint used to start the API.
- **DeploymentGuide**: Represents documentation for Windows service deployment.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The entrypoint starts the API using defaults when no environment variables are set.
- **SC-002**: Invalid environment values do not prevent the API from starting.
- **SC-003**: Deployment instructions enable a successful Windows service installation and health check.
